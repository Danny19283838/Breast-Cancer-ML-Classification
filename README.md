**Breast Cancer Malignancy Prediction Using Machine Learning:**
This project develops and evaluates machine learning models to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the scikit-learn breast cancer dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation metrics, and visualization of model performance.


**Skills Demonstrated:**
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

Supervised machine learning

Logistic Regression & Random Forest classification

Train/test splitting & model validation

ROC curve & AUC analysis

Confusion matrix interpretation

Feature importance visualization

End-to-end ML workflow





**Models Used:**
1. Logistic Regression

Baseline interpretable classifier
Good for linear decision boundaries
Produces probability outputs
Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC


2. Random Forest Classifier

Ensemble tree-based method
Handles nonlinear relationships
Provides feature importance scores
Typically, higher predictive performance






**Key Evaluation Metrics:**
Accuracy
Precision / Recall
F1-score
Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve & AUC
Feature Importance
These metrics provide a complete picture of model performance and reliability.
